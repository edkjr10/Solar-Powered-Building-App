# Solar-Powered-Building-App

A mobile app for a solar-powered system was my final project as a Senior at Texas A&M.
The collection of main nessecary files can be found here with a description of available feature.

The graphical interface was coded using XML.

The development was coded using Java, while communicating with a Firebase Realtime Database.
